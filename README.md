# MegaAV
Sega Genesis audio and video bypass, incorporating a new Mega Amp design that restores mono audio, along with native composite and S-video generation.

Also adds a ZIF connector for a future ribbon cable design to greatly simplify installation

(instructions pending, same as 3bp install except composite and mono must also be isolated from the din, and the subcarrier line must be routed to the MegaAV)
### When routing the subcarrier line, make sure it's a shielded coaxial cable or twisted pair to prevent jailbars

Instructions pending:
